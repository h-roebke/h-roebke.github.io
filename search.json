    "text": "In 2001, Frank Solich led his Nebraska football team to the Rose Bowl, competing for the national championship. This came even after the Huskers failed to qualify for the Big 12 championship game and suffered a regular season loss to Colorado. Nebraska had even managed to secure this spot ahead of #3 Colorado and #2 Oregon.\nHowever, fast forward to 2003, after a final regular season victory against Kansas State, Nebraska’s athletic director, Steve Pederson, made the controversial decision to fire Frank Solich. This decision rasies the questions: Was this the start of Nebraska’s losing curse? Statistically did Frank Solich deserve to be fired?\n\n\nCode\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(ggalt)\nlibrary(ggtext)\nlibrary(ggrepel)\n\ncfb98 &lt;- read_csv(\"CFBRatings1998.csv\") |&gt; mutate(Season = 1998)\n\ncfb99 &lt;- read_csv(\"CFBRatings1999.csv\") |&gt; mutate(Season = 1999)\n\ncfb00 &lt;- read_csv(\"CFBRatings2000.csv\") |&gt; mutate(Season = 2000)\n\ncfb01 &lt;- read_csv(\"CFBRatings2001.csv\") |&gt; mutate(Season = 2001)\n\ncfb02 &lt;- read_csv(\"CFBRatings2002.csv\") |&gt; mutate(Season = 2002)\n\ncfb03 &lt;- read_csv(\"CFBRatings2003.csv\") |&gt; mutate(Season = 2003)\n\ncfb04 &lt;- read_csv(\"CFBRatings2004.csv\") |&gt; mutate(Season = 2004)\n\ncfb05 &lt;- read_csv(\"CFBRatings2005.csv\") |&gt; mutate(Season = 2005)\n\ncfb06 &lt;- read_csv(\"CFBRatings2006.csv\") |&gt; mutate(Season = 2006)\n\ncfb07 &lt;- read_csv(\"CFBRatings2007.csv\") |&gt; mutate(Season = 2007)\n\ncfb08 &lt;- read_csv(\"CFBRatings2008.csv\") |&gt; mutate(Season = 2008)\n\ncfb09 &lt;- read_csv(\"CFBRatings2009.csv\") |&gt; mutate(Season = 2009)\n\ncfb10 &lt;- read_csv(\"CFBRatings2010.csv\") |&gt; mutate(Season = 2010)\n\ncfb11 &lt;- read_csv(\"CFBRatings2011.csv\") |&gt; mutate(Season = 2011)\n\ncfb12 &lt;- read_csv(\"CFBRatings2012.csv\") |&gt; mutate(Season = 2012)\n\ncfb13 &lt;- read_csv(\"CFBRatings2013.csv\") |&gt; mutate(Season = 2013)\n\ncfb14 &lt;- read_csv(\"CFBRatings2014.csv\") |&gt; mutate(Season = 2014)\n\ncfb15 &lt;- read_csv(\"CFBRatings2015.csv\") |&gt; mutate(Season = 2015)\n\ncfb16 &lt;- read_csv(\"CFBRatings2016.csv\") |&gt; mutate(Season = 2016)\n\ncfb17 &lt;- read_csv(\"CFBRatings2017.csv\") |&gt; mutate(Season = 2017)\n\ncfb18 &lt;- read_csv(\"CFBRatings2018.csv\") |&gt; mutate(Season = 2018)\n\ncfb19 &lt;- read_csv(\"CFBRatings2019.csv\") |&gt; mutate(Season = 2019)\n\ncfb20 &lt;- read_csv(\"CFBRatings2020.csv\") |&gt; mutate(Season = 2020)\n\ncfb21 &lt;- read_csv(\"CFBRatings2021.csv\") |&gt; mutate(Season = 2021)\n\ncfb22 &lt;- read_csv(\"CFBRatings2022.csv\") |&gt; mutate(Season = 2022)\n\nfblogs &lt;- bind_rows(cfb98, cfb99, cfb00, cfb01, cfb02, cfb03, cfb04, cfb05, cfb06, cfb07, cfb08, cfb09, cfb10, cfb11, cfb12, cfb13, cfb14, cfb15, cfb16, cfb17, cfb18, cfb19, cfb20, cfb21, cfb22)\n\nbig &lt;- c(\"Nebraska\", \"Iowa\", \"Minnesota\", \"Wisconsin\", \"Illinois\", \"Northwestern\", \"Purdue\", \"Indiana\", \"Michigan\", \"Michigan State\", \"Penn State\", \"Ohio State\", \"Rutgers\", \"Maryland\")\n\nbigten &lt;- fblogs |&gt;\n  filter(\n    School %in% big\n  ) |&gt;\n  group_by(School) |&gt; \n  arrange(Season) |&gt; \n  mutate(\n    totalwins=cumsum(W) \n  ) |&gt;\n  mutate(\n    teamseason=paste(School, Season)\n  )\n\nos &lt;- bigten |&gt; filter(School == \"Ohio State\")\nwi &lt;- bigten |&gt; filter(School == \"Wisconsin\")\npu &lt;- bigten |&gt; filter(School == \"Purdue\")\nps &lt;- bigten |&gt; filter(School == \"Penn State\")\nmi &lt;- bigten |&gt; filter(School == \"Michigan\")\nms &lt;- bigten |&gt; filter(School == \"Michigan State\")\nid &lt;- bigten |&gt; filter(School == \"Indiana\")\nia &lt;- bigten |&gt; filter(School == \"Iowa\")\nnw &lt;- bigten |&gt; filter(School == \"Northwestern\")\nil &lt;- bigten |&gt; filter(School == \"Illinois\")\nwi &lt;- bigten |&gt; filter(School == \"Wisconsin\")\nrt &lt;- bigten |&gt; filter(School == \"Rutgers\")\nmy &lt;- bigten |&gt; filter(School == \"Maryland\")\nnu &lt;- bigten |&gt; filter(School == \"Nebraska\") \n\nggplot() + \n  geom_step(data=bigten, aes(x=Season, y=totalwins, group=School), color=\"grey\") + \n  geom_step(data=nu, aes(x=Season, y=totalwins), color=\"#E41C38\") +\n  geom_step(data=mi, aes(x=Season, y=totalwins), color=\"#FFCB05\") +\n  geom_step(data=os, aes(x=Season, y=totalwins), color=\"#BB0000\") +\n  geom_text(data=nu |&gt; filter(Season == max(Season)), aes(x=Season, y=totalwins, label=School), color=\"#E41C38\") +\n  geom_text(data=mi |&gt; filter(Season == max(Season)), aes(x=Season, y=totalwins, label=School), color=\"#00274C\") +\n  geom_text(data=os |&gt; filter(Season == max(Season)), aes(x=Season, y=totalwins, label=School), color=\"#BB0000\") +  \n  geom_text(aes(x=2000, y=100), label=\"Frank Solich fired\", color=\"#E41C38\") +\n\n  labs(x=\"Season\", y=\"Total Wins\", title=\"The Huskers Have Gotten Slower At Winning\", subtitle=\"Nebraska's Win Rate Has Slowed Down Over The Past Decade\", caption=\"Source: Sports Reference | By Hannah Roebke\") +\n  scale_x_continuous(limits=c(1998, 2025)) +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  theme(\n    plot.title = element_text(size = 20, face = \"bold\"),\n    plot.subtitle = element_text(size=12), \n    axis.title = element_text(size = 10),\n    plot.title.position = \"plot\"\n  ) +\ngeom_vline(xintercept=2003, color=\"black\")\n\n\n\n\n\nFrank Solich compiled a 58-19 record at Nebraska. Solich won at least nine games in five of his six seasons at Nebraska, finishing in the top 10 nationally three times. His 58 wins during his coaching career at Nebraska surpassed the win records of several Nebraska and College Football Hall of Fame legends. His victories surpassed Bob Devaney’s 53 wins and Osborne’s 55, making Solich one of the winningest coaches in Nebraska coaching history. Since Solich’s firing Nebraska’s win rate has only gotten slower.\n\n\nCode\nggplot() + \n  geom_point(\n    data=bigten, \n    aes(x=Season, y=SRS, size=W), \n    color=\"grey\", \n    alpha=.3) + \n  geom_point(\n    data=nu, \n    aes(x=Season, y=SRS, size=W), \n    color=\"#E41C38\") +\nlabs(x=\"Season\", y=\"SRS Rating\", title=\"Nebraska's SRS Rating Has Only Gotten Worse Since 2000\", subtitle=\"The Huskers Had The Highest SRS Ratings under Frank Solich\", caption=\"Source: Sports Reference | By Hannah Roebke\") +\n  theme_minimal() +\n   theme(\n    plot.title = element_text(size = 18, face = \"bold\"),\n    plot.subtitle = element_text(size=12), \n    axis.title = element_text(size = 10),\n    plot.title.position = \"plot\"\n  )\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCode\nnulabel &lt;- nu |&gt;\n  filter(\n    Season == 1998 | Season == 1999 | Season == 2000 | Season == 2001 | Season == 2002 | Season == 2003\n  )\n\nggplot() + \n  geom_point(data=bigten, aes(x=OSRS, y=DSRS), color=\"lightgrey\") +\n  geom_point(data=nu, aes(x=OSRS, y=DSRS), color=\"#E41C38\") +\n    geom_text_repel(data=nulabel, aes(x=OSRS, y=DSRS, label=teamseason)) +\n  geom_vline(xintercept=0, color=\"lightblue\") +\n  geom_hline(yintercept=0, color=\"lightblue\") +\n  labs(\n    x=\"Offensive Rating\", \n    y=\"Defensive Rating\", \n    title=\"Huskers Above Average On Both Sides Of The Ball Under Solich\", \n    subtitle=\"Nebraska's offensive and defense performed above average every year Frank Solich was head coach\", \n    caption=\"Source: Sports Reference | By Hannah Roebke\"\n    ) +\n  theme_minimal() +\n   theme(\n    plot.title = element_text(size = 16, face = \"bold\"),\n    plot.subtitle = element_text(size=11), \n    axis.title = element_text(size = 10),\n    plot.title.position = \"plot\"\n  )\n\n\n\n\n\nNebraska thrived under Solich’s leadership, excelling on both offense and defense. In the 1999 season, the Huskers’ defense held Texas to just 6 points during the Big 12 championship game, while the offense scored 22 points to secure the title. 1999 marked one of the highest offensive and defensive ratings in Nebraska’s history. Furthermore, throughout Solich’s coaching career, the Huskers consistently outperformed on both sides of the ball. Nebraska’s offense became known for its option plays, and introduced the iconic flash reverse pass, a play that played a pivotal role in Eric Crouch’s Heisman Trophy win in 2001. Frank Solich’s leadership paved the way for record-setting performances on both sides of the ball.\nStatistically, Frank Solich produced some of the best stats Nebraska has seen in the past decade and led the Huskers to more conference and national championships than Nebraska has seen in the past 20 seasons. Frank Solich should have kept his job and we should be playing the sign stealing Wolverines for the Big Ten Championship."
