The Royals’ bullpen finished in the bottom in terms of earned run average. Allowing on average only roughly three runs per game. However, after their World Series victory, Kansas City has continued to allow more and more runs per season. There was an exception to the pattern during the 2020 Covid season, however even based on the data from the games that were played the Royals still allowed almost five runs on average. The past few seasons have continued to prove that the Royals need to do some work to improve their bullpen.\n\n\nCode\nbatting15 &lt;- read_csv(\"Batting15.csv\")\n\nbatting23 &lt;- read_csv(\"Batting23.csv\")\n\nbattingpct2023 &lt;- read_csv(\"Batting23.csv\") |&gt;\n  mutate(Season = 2023) \n\nbattingpct2015 &lt;- read_csv(\"Batting15.csv\") |&gt;\n  mutate(Season = 2015) \n\nbattingpct &lt;- bind_rows(battingpct2015, battingpct2023) |&gt; filter(is.na(Tm) == FALSE) |&gt; filter(Tm != \"League Average\") |&gt; mutate(Tm = gsub(\"Indians\", \"Guardians\", Tm)) |&gt; mutate(Tm = gsub(\" of Anaheim\", \"\", Tm))\n\n\n\n\nCode\nggplot() + \n  geom_hline(yintercept=0.7275469   , color=\"#BD9B60\") + \n geom_line(data=battingpct, aes(x=Season, y=OPS, group=Tm)) + \n  facet_wrap(~Tm) +\n  labs(x=\"Season\", y=\"OPS\", title=\"Kansas City plunges to persistent lows on OPS rollercoaster\", subtitle=\"Since their World Series victory, the Royals are only one of eleven teams whose OPS rating has declined over the past \nseven seasons.\", caption=\"Source: Sports Reference | By Hannah Roebke\") +\n   scale_x_continuous(breaks=c(2015, 2023), limits=c(2014,2024)) +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  theme(\n    plot.title = element_text(size = 19, face = \"bold\"),\n    plot.subtitle = element_text(size=12), \n    axis.title = element_text(size = 10),\n    plot.title.position = \"plot\")\n\n\n\n\n\nAnother strength during the 2014 and 2015 seasons was the Royals’ hitting. During those seasons KC hit above the league average. However through player trades and retirements, the bats have turned cold and it has been a free fall to the bottom of the MLB standings in terms of on base percentage.\nIt is clear that the Royals are nowhere near the top of the season standings. Pitching and hitting are at the source of the problem for the Royals struggles. If they can obtain a better bullpen and start hitting the ball they can perhaps start winning more games and make a run at the World Series once again."

    "text": "In 2001, Frank Solich led his Nebraska football team to the Rose Bowl, competing for the national championship. This came even after the Huskers failed to qualify for the Big 12 championship game and suffered a regular season loss to Colorado. Nebraska had even managed to secure this spot ahead of #3 Colorado and #2 Oregon.\nHowever, fast forward to 2003, after a final regular season victory against Kansas State, Nebraska’s athletic director, Steve Pederson, made the controversial decision to fire Frank Solich. This decision rasies the questions: Was this the start of Nebraska’s losing curse? Statistically did Frank Solich deserve to be fired?\n\n\nCode\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(ggalt)\nlibrary(ggtext)\nlibrary(ggrepel)\n\ncfb98 &lt;- read_csv(\"CFBRatings1998.csv\") |&gt; mutate(Season = 1998)\n\ncfb99 &lt;- read_csv(\"CFBRatings1999.csv\") |&gt; mutate(Season = 1999)\n\ncfb00 &lt;- read_csv(\"CFBRatings2000.csv\") |&gt; mutate(Season = 2000)\n\ncfb01 &lt;- read_csv(\"CFBRatings2001.csv\") |&gt; mutate(Season = 2001)\n\ncfb02 &lt;- read_csv(\"CFBRatings2002.csv\") |&gt; mutate(Season = 2002)\n\ncfb03 &lt;- read_csv(\"CFBRatings2003.csv\") |&gt; mutate(Season = 2003)\n\ncfb04 &lt;- read_csv(\"CFBRatings2004.csv\") |&gt; mutate(Season = 2004)\n\ncfb05 &lt;- read_csv(\"CFBRatings2005.csv\") |&gt; mutate(Season = 2005)\n\ncfb06 &lt;- read_csv(\"CFBRatings2006.csv\") |&gt; mutate(Season = 2006)\n\ncfb07 &lt;- read_csv(\"CFBRatings2007.csv\") |&gt; mutate(Season = 2007)\n\ncfb08 &lt;- read_csv(\"CFBRatings2008.csv\") |&gt; mutate(Season = 2008)\n\ncfb09 &lt;- read_csv(\"CFBRatings2009.csv\") |&gt; mutate(Season = 2009)\n\ncfb10 &lt;- read_csv(\"CFBRatings2010.csv\") |&gt; mutate(Season = 2010)\n\ncfb11 &lt;- read_csv(\"CFBRatings2011.csv\") |&gt; mutate(Season = 2011)\n\ncfb12 &lt;- read_csv(\"CFBRatings2012.csv\") |&gt; mutate(Season = 2012)\n\ncfb13 &lt;- read_csv(\"CFBRatings2013.csv\") |&gt; mutate(Season = 2013)\n\ncfb14 &lt;- read_csv(\"CFBRatings2014.csv\") |&gt; mutate(Season = 2014)\n\ncfb15 &lt;- read_csv(\"CFBRatings2015.csv\") |&gt; mutate(Season = 2015)\n\ncfb16 &lt;- read_csv(\"CFBRatings2016.csv\") |&gt; mutate(Season = 2016)\n\ncfb17 &lt;- read_csv(\"CFBRatings2017.csv\") |&gt; mutate(Season = 2017)\n\ncfb18 &lt;- read_csv(\"CFBRatings2018.csv\") |&gt; mutate(Season = 2018)\n\ncfb19 &lt;- read_csv(\"CFBRatings2019.csv\") |&gt; mutate(Season = 2019)\n\ncfb20 &lt;- read_csv(\"CFBRatings2020.csv\") |&gt; mutate(Season = 2020)\n\ncfb21 &lt;- read_csv(\"CFBRatings2021.csv\") |&gt; mutate(Season = 2021)\n\ncfb22 &lt;- read_csv(\"CFBRatings2022.csv\") |&gt; mutate(Season = 2022)\n\nfblogs &lt;- bind_rows(cfb98, cfb99, cfb00, cfb01, cfb02, cfb03, cfb04, cfb05, cfb06, cfb07, cfb08, cfb09, cfb10, cfb11, cfb12, cfb13, cfb14, cfb15, cfb16, cfb17, cfb18, cfb19, cfb20, cfb21, cfb22)\n\nbig &lt;- c(\"Nebraska\", \"Iowa\", \"Minnesota\", \"Wisconsin\", \"Illinois\", \"Northwestern\", \"Purdue\", \"Indiana\", \"Michigan\", \"Michigan State\", \"Penn State\", \"Ohio State\", \"Rutgers\", \"Maryland\")\n\nbigten &lt;- fblogs |&gt;\n  filter(\n    School %in% big\n  ) |&gt;\n  group_by(School) |&gt; \n  arrange(Season) |&gt; \n  mutate(\n    totalwins=cumsum(W) \n  ) |&gt;\n  mutate(\n    teamseason=paste(School, Season)\n  )\n\nos &lt;- bigten |&gt; filter(School == \"Ohio State\")\nwi &lt;- bigten |&gt; filter(School == \"Wisconsin\")\npu &lt;- bigten |&gt; filter(School == \"Purdue\")\nps &lt;- bigten |&gt; filter(School == \"Penn State\")\nmi &lt;- bigten |&gt; filter(School == \"Michigan\")\nms &lt;- bigten |&gt; filter(School == \"Michigan State\")\nid &lt;- bigten |&gt; filter(School == \"Indiana\")\nia &lt;- bigten |&gt; filter(School == \"Iowa\")\nnw &lt;- bigten |&gt; filter(School == \"Northwestern\")\nil &lt;- bigten |&gt; filter(School == \"Illinois\")\nwi &lt;- bigten |&gt; filter(School == \"Wisconsin\")\nrt &lt;- bigten |&gt; filter(School == \"Rutgers\")\nmy &lt;- bigten |&gt; filter(School == \"Maryland\")\nnu &lt;- bigten |&gt; filter(School == \"Nebraska\") \n\nggplot() + \n  geom_step(data=bigten, aes(x=Season, y=totalwins, group=School), color=\"grey\") + \n  geom_step(data=nu, aes(x=Season, y=totalwins), color=\"#E41C38\") +\n  geom_step(data=mi, aes(x=Season, y=totalwins), color=\"#FFCB05\") +\n  geom_step(data=os, aes(x=Season, y=totalwins), color=\"#BB0000\") +\n  geom_text(data=nu |&gt; filter(Season == max(Season)), aes(x=Season, y=totalwins, label=School), color=\"#E41C38\") +\n  geom_text(data=mi |&gt; filter(Season == max(Season)), aes(x=Season, y=totalwins, label=School), color=\"#00274C\") +\n  geom_text(data=os |&gt; filter(Season == max(Season)), aes(x=Season, y=totalwins, label=School), color=\"#BB0000\") +  \n  geom_text(aes(x=2000, y=100), label=\"Frank Solich fired\", color=\"#E41C38\") +\n\n  labs(x=\"Season\", y=\"Total Wins\", title=\"The Huskers Have Gotten Slower At Winning\", subtitle=\"Nebraska's Win Rate Has Slowed Down Over The Past Decade\", caption=\"Source: Sports Reference | By Hannah Roebke\") +\n  scale_x_continuous(limits=c(1998, 2025)) +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  theme(\n    plot.title = element_text(size = 20, face = \"bold\"),\n    plot.subtitle = element_text(size=12), \n    axis.title = element_text(size = 10),\n    plot.title.position = \"plot\"\n  ) +\ngeom_vline(xintercept=2003, color=\"black\")\n\n\n\n\n\nFrank Solich compiled a 58-19 record at Nebraska.

His victories surpassed Bob Devaney’s 53 wins and Osborne’s 55, making Solich one of the winningest coaches in Nebraska coaching history.

In the 1999 season, the Huskers’ defense held Texas to just 6 points during the Big 12 championship game, while the offense scored 22 points to secure the title. 1999 marked one of the highest offensive and defensive ratings in Nebraska’s history. Furthermore, throughout Solich’s coaching career, the Huskers consistently outperformed on both sides of the ball. Nebraska’s offense became known for its option plays, and introduced the iconic flash reverse pass, a play that played a pivotal role in Eric Crouch’s Heisman Trophy win in 2001. Frank Solich’s leadership paved the way for record-setting performances on both sides of the ball.\nStatistically, Frank Solich produced some of the best stats Nebraska has seen in the past decade and led the Huskers to more conference and national championships than Nebraska has seen in the past 20 seasons. Frank Solich should have kept his job and we should be playing the sign stealing Wolverines for the Big Ten Championship."
